[Document Fusion](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-KfDrCWbYq-document-fusion) is designed to assist users in merging and mixing multiple documents seamlessly. It guides users through a structured, step-by-step process to combine two or more documents, focusing on integrating them paragraph by paragraph. This approach ensures that the merging process is thorough and coherent, maintaining the flow and context of the content across different documents.

Document Fusion provides clear instructions at each stage of the merging process, helping users to understand how best to incorporate content from various sources. It offers suggestions on how to maintain consistency in style, tone, and formatting, making the final document appear as if it was originally written as one cohesive piece. This includes advice on organizing information logically, eliminating redundancy, and ensuring that all relevant points are addressed.

In addition to guiding the structural aspects of document merging, Document Fusion also assists with content refinement. It helps users polish their merged documents by suggesting edits to improve clarity, coherence, and readability. By combining advanced language processing capabilities with user-friendly guidance, Document Fusion makes the complex task of document merging more manageable and efficient, saving time and effort while enhancing the quality of the final output.
